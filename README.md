# AlgoViz: Interactive Sorting Algorithm Visualizer

## Overview

**AlgoViz** is a Progressive Web App (PWA) developed with ReactJS to visualize various classic sorting algorithms. The tool provides real-time, interactive animations that help users better understand how these algorithms function across multiple platforms.

## Features

- **Interactive animations**: Users can see how sorting algorithms like Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, and others work step by step.
- **Cross-platform compatibility**: Being a PWA, AlgoViz works seamlessly on desktop and mobile platforms.
- **User control**: Users can control the speed of animations, shuffle the data, and select different array sizes.
- **Educational tool**: Designed to help users understand sorting algorithms in an intuitive, visual manner.

## Tech Stack

- **ReactJS**: For building the user interface and handling state.
- **CSS**: For styling and responsive design.

## Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** (v12+)
- **npm** or **yarn**

### Steps to Setup:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/tpstark137/AlgoViz.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd AlgoViz
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
   or if using yarn:
   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```
4. Run the development server:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   or with yarn:

   ```bash
   yarn start
   ```

5. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to view the application.

## Usage

- Select a sorting algorithm from the dropdown menu.
- Adjust the array size and animation speed using the available controls.
- Press "Sort" to begin the visualization and watch the algorithm work in real-time.
- Use "Shuffle" to randomize the array again for a new sorting session.

## Supported Sorting Algorithms

- **Bubble Sort**
- **Selection Sort**
- **Insertion Sort**
- **Merge Sort**
- **Quick Sort**
- **Heap Sort**

## Future Enhancements

- Adding more algorithms such as Radix Sort, Counting Sort, etc.
- Improving the UI/UX with additional themes.
- Introducing detailed explanations for each step in the algorithms.
- Adding support for custom user input arrays.
